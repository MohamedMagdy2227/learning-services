## Overview

The Learning Services is an intelligent backend engine designed to
generate personalized educational roadmaps and learning materials. By
leveraging user profile data (such as learning styles, study time, and
goals) alongside specific target subtopics, the system dynamically
fetches, processes, and curates educational content. It utilizes
external tools like the Tavily API for web searching and integrates a
sophisticated Vector Database pipeline for processing and generating
quizzes, mindmaps, and summaries.

## System Architecture & Workflow

Below is the high-level data flow of the Learning Services AI Engine:

### Step-by-Step Flow Explanation

1. **Input Collection:** The system takes "Sign up preferences" (user
    tracks, learning style) and the "Target Subtopic" (name,
    description, difficulty).
2. **Web Search & Extraction:** A query is dynamically built and sent
    to the Tavily web search tool to fetch relevant articles, courses
    (Coursera, Udemy), and YouTube videos. The content is then extracted
    and cleaned (removing HTML tags, boilerplate text, and URLs).
3. **LLM Reranker / Judge:** The extracted content is evaluated by a
    Large Language Model (LLM) to determine its relevance and quality.
    The best sources are stored in the database and presented in the
    user's roadmap.
4. **Vector Database Pipeline:** When a user selects a specific content
    source, the system fetches the raw data (via PDF extraction, web
    scraping, or video transcript extraction). The text is cleaned,
    chunked into smaller pieces, converted into embeddings, and stored
    in a Vector Database.
5. **Content Generation:** The user can request specific outputs like a
    Quiz, Mindmap, or Summary. The system uses an LLM to reformulate the
    query, searches the Vector Database for the top K relevant chunks,
    and feeds them into another LLM to generate the final educational
    material, which is then stored in the database.

## Feature: Quiz Generation
   An AI-powered learning feature that transforms the learner’s selected **content source** (best course, best video, or best blog) into a personalized study experience and instant feedback.
    It uses the selected source as the primary knowledge base, supplements it with supporting ranked sources when needed, and adapts question difficulty dynamically based on some factors that will be explained later.After each answer, the learner receives immediate corrective feedback,At the end of the session the system produces weakness summary, key concepts to review, and optional AI-generated visual or audio learning aids.

### Quiz Generation workflow

## Feature: Summarization
 The Summarization feature provides structured learning by distilling content stored in a Qdrant vector database. The service automatically queries the database to retrieve the top three most relevant sections for a specific topic and processes them through a Flan-T5 NLP pipeline. This workflow ensures that every generated summary is technically accurate and grounded in verified data, transforming dense database records into clear, beginner-friendly insights while maintaining strict data integrity.

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized modularly to separate API routing, core configurations, data models, and the AI engine logic:

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. It is highly recommended to use a
virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the project to your local machine and navigate into the project
directory.

### 3. Environment Setup

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

``` bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the provided
example:

``` env
APP_NAME="Learning Services"
APP_VERSION="1.0.0"
MAIN_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:3000"
TAVILY_API_KEY="Your Tavily api key"
GEMINI_API_KEY = "Your Gemini api key"
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages from the requirements file:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Setup Pre-commit Hooks

To ensure code quality, install the pre-commit hooks before making any
contributions:

``` bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## Running the Application

To start the FastAPI development server, run:

``` bash
uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`. You can view the
automatic API documentation by navigating to
`http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## Testing

The project uses `pytest` for testing.

To run all standard unit tests:

``` bash
pytest
```

To run integration tests (which make actual calls to external APIs like
Tavily), use the custom integration flag:

``` bash
pytest --integration
```

## Contribution Guidelines & Git Workflow

To maintain high code quality and avoid merge conflicts, all team
members **MUST** strictly follow these rules:

### 1. Branching Strategy

- **`main`**: Production-ready code ONLY. Direct pushes are blocked.
- **`develop`**: The integration branch. All feature branches must
    branch off from here and merge back here.

**Feature Branches Naming Convention:**

- `feat/feature-name` (e.g., `feat/pdf-extraction`)
- `fix/bug-name` (e.g., `fix/db-connection`)
- `chore/task-name` (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`)
- `docs/document-name` (e.g., `docs/api-endpoints`)

### 2. Commits

Use descriptive, conventional commit messages:

- **Allowed:** `feat: add Tavily web search integration`
- **Allowed:** `fix: handle empty pdf files during extraction`
- **Allowed:** `chore: update requirements.txt`
- **Not Allowed:** `fixed bug` or `updated files` or `done`

### 3. Pull Requests (PRs)

- **Direct pushes to `main` or `develop` are BLOCKED.**
- Push your feature branch to GitHub and open a Pull Request against
    the `develop` branch.
- Fill out the provided PR Template.
- Wait for at least **1 Approval** (from the Team Lead) before
    merging.
- Ensure your code doesn't break existing functionality before
    requesting a review.
